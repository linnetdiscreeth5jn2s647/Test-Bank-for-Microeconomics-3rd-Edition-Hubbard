  * Hubbard & O'Brien is the only book that motivates students to learn economics through real business examples.
 
  * The #1 question students of economics ask themselves is:  "Why am I here, and will I ever use this?"  Hubbard/O'Brien answer this question by demonstrating that real businesses use economics to make real decisions daily.  This is motivating to all students, whether they are business majors or not.  All students can relate to businesses they encounter in their everyday lives.  Whether they open an art studio, do social work, trade on Wall Street, work for the government, or bartend at the local pub, students will benefit from understanding the economic forces behind their work.
 
  * The book motivates users by demonstrating how real businesses use economics to make real decisions on a daily basis.  Covers the different Market Structures in an intuitive fashion so that readers of all backgrounds and fields can grasp the importance and flow of these concepts.  Chapter opening cases, examples and figures motivate the economic principles covered, while Solved Problems provide models of how to solve an econommic problem - keeping readers focused on the main ideas of each chapter, and preventing them from getting bogged down due to a lack of basic math or "word problem" skills.
